Mobile Wall of Sheep for OSSCON 2024

The Mobile Wall of Sheep is a demonstration project for OSSCON 2024, designed to educate attendees on the potential security risks associated with scanning QR codes and visiting websites. Through interactive displays, participants will learn how seemingly innocuous actions, like scanning a QR code, can expose personal device information.
